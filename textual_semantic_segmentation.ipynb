And that's why we founded The CRNA Club. Here at the CRNA Club our mission is to provide education and resources for the aspiring CRNA, student, and current practitioner. We are a community of anesthesia-obsessed individuals who are committed to sharing education and tools to further the profession. Community focused. Our goal is to foster a community of like-minded individuals who share the common passion of anesthesia. We love education, research and innovation, and our goal is to inspire those around us to take one step closer toward achieving their goals and dreams. We don't do normal. We overdeliver. From the way we teach, to the tools we provide, we believe in standing out and doing things differently. We believe in innovation and forward-thinking, and are constantly pushing the envelope with our resources and methods. We love good humans. We believe in treating people with respect and kindness. From strangers on the Internet, to our SRNAs and fellow colleagues, we practice the Golden Rule. We value transparency and doing the right thing, even when nobody is looking. We promise to bring inclusivity, openness and acceptance to every interaction. For the CRNA school applicant, helpful articles and resources. Check out our most popular applicant resource, The CRNA School Database. Applying to CRNA school? Our digital courses will take you further, faster.

And that's why we founded The CRNA Club. Here at the CRNA Club our mission is to provide education and resources for the aspiring CRNA, student, and current practitioner. We are a community of anesthesia-obsessed individuals who are committed to sharing education and tools to further the profession. Community focused. Our goal is to foster a community of like-minded individuals who share the common passion of anesthesia. We love education, research and innovation, and our goal is to inspire those around us to take one step closer toward achieving their goals and dreams. We don't do normal. We overdeliver. From the way we teach, to the tools we provide, we believe in standing out and doing things differently. We believe in innovation and forward-thinking, and are constantly pushing the envelope with our resources and methods. We love good humans. We believe in treating people with respect and kindness. From strangers on the Internet, to our SRNAs and fellow colleagues, we practice the Golden Rule. We value transparency and doing the right thing, even when nobody is looking. We promise to bring inclusivity, openness and acceptance to every interaction. For the CRNA school applicant, helpful articles and resources. Check out our most popular applicant resource, The CRNA School Database. Applying to CRNA school? Our digital courses will take you further, faster.
