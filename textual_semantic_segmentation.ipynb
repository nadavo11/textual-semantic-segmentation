This natural product can help with a huge variety of health conditions in adults, children and animals. It\\u2019s known to be effective against 650 strains of bacteria, viruses and fungi, and is well-known for its skin healing properties if made correctly. \\u00a0Colloidal Silver is also the key ingredient in our topical products which means we don\\u2019t have to use any nasty artificial preservatives or parabens, so you can rest assured our products are as natural and safe as they can be.                       An ancient remedy                     Silver as a natural treatment is nothing new. As far back as Ancient Greece, they used a silver coin in a barrel of water to stop bacteria growing. Since then, it has been used throughout the ages to fight infection, in everything from hospitals to water systems.In the early 20th Century, colloidal silver was used by doctors as it proved enormously effective against bacteria. Its use declined after 1938 when antibiotics were introduced. However, not even 100 years on and we are seeing resistance to antibiotics, and since the 70s there has been a renewed interest in Colloidal Silver.Nowadays, NASA uses a silver water system in its space shuttles, and many airlines use silver water filters. Silver is also used by hospitals in burns units and to dress wounds, as well as being used in public buildings in the UK to prevent Legionnaires disease and bacteria.Curious to know more?Delve into the history of silver here\\u201cSilver has been used for centuries. Hippocrates wrote about the use of silver in wound care\\u2026 WW1 soldiers used silver leaf to treat infected wounds.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0                       Using it today                     Use it daily to enhance your body\\u2019s immune system, or as a first aid remedy to naturally fight infection, ailments and skin concerns. It\\u2019s also used by those with illnesses or skin conditions that cannot be treated conventionally, or who want an alternative to modern drugs.\\u201cOnce people discover our products, they find they can use them to help with so many things, and the products become a staple part of the family first aid kit.\\u201d\\u00a0 Lucy Roberts, Managing Director, Active Silver                       How does it work?                     Like with anything in life, nature seeks to be balanced, or neutral. Our bodies contain both good and bad bacteria. \\u2018Good\\u2019 bacteria helps our bodies to function and provides a balance, having equal amounts of positive and negative electrical charges (ions).\\u2018Bad\\u2019 bacteria is unbalanced because it has more negative than positive ions. Each of the silver particles in our Colloidal Silver is positively charged using our advanced electrolysis technique. Once ingested or in contact with skin, these particles are attracted to the spare negative ions in \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria. The Colloidal Silver rips these negative ions away, causing the \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria to die. The silver is then cleared out of the body by the immune, lymphatic and elimination systems.It's impossible for bacteria to build up a resistance to Colloidal Silver. Providing the right concentration and particle size has been used, the Colloidal Silver is rapidly absorbed into the upper gastrointestinal tract, leaving little to interact with the beneficial \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria in our intestines.Antibiotics kill the \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria that is so vital for our gut. This, coupled with the growing resistance to modern antibiotics, encourages more people to turn to Colloidal Silver. Interestingly, Colloidal Silver actually helps to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics too.                       What can Colloidal Silver be used for?                     Abscess, Acne, Allergies, Asthma, Athletes Foot, Bites, Bladder infections, Boils, Bronchitis, Burns, Candida albicans (thrush), Catarrh, Chicken Pox, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Colds, Congestion, Conjunctivitis, Coughs, Cuts, Cysts, Cystitis, Dandruff, Dermatitis, Ear infections, Eczema, Eye infections, Gastrointestinal distress, Headaches, Herpes virus, Influenza, Intestinal disorders, Legionnaires disease, Lesions, Molluscum, Pneumonia, Prickly Heat, Prostate disorders, Psoriasis, Rhinitis, Ringworm, Rosacea, Scars, Shingles, Sinusitis, Skin irritations and issues, Sores, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus infections, Sunburn, Sun spots, Thyroid conditions, Toothache, Tonsillitis, Ulcers, Verrucas, Warts, Yeast infections\\u2026 and much more.Colloidal Silver can also be used as disinfectant around the home, and on animals too.

\",\n          \"About Us We are a family business based in South-East Cambridgeshire specialising in the healthy, natural foods that make up the Cretan Diet. Yannis Borakis tells \\u201cWhen I first came to England over 30 years ago, there was a lot about the British diet I loved: apple pies and custard, fish and chips, Sunday roasts, cream teas, bangers and mash! But I really missed my olive oil and just couldn\\u2019t find anything in the supermarkets that came close to what I was used to.\\u00a0In Crete, we use lots and lots of olive oil. We use it in all our cooking, not just on salads, we even use it in our cakes and pastry \\u2013 and to cook chips! It\\u2019s much more than a cooking oil, it\\u2019s a flavouring ingredient, just like salt and pepper, herbs or lemon juice, and the main reason why the Cretan diet is so healthy.\\u00a0I started importing my own olive oil from my father\\u2019s farm, a barrel at a time (we do consume rather a lot!). Pretty soon friends who came to eat with us were asking me if they could buy some from me. I decided to have it bottled and imported it to sell in the UK.\\u00a0My family has been farming for generations in the White mountains of North-western Crete. After success with the olive oil, I asked my Uncle to send me some of our traditional cheeses. These are all produced from goat and sheep milk (there are no cows on Crete!) and hand-made according to traditional methods. I then asked my brother, who keeps bees to send me honey. Cretan Thyme honey has a strong flavour and is much prized in Greece and around the world.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The Papadakis Family, who produce Borakis Greek Mountain Honey in the village of Therisso, Crete\\u00a0Anne Borakis adds \\\"when Yannis began importing Cretan food, he began selling it at local farmers markets. He had a very positive response from customers, and pretty soon there were queues forming at his weekly stall. Customers began to ask for recipe ideas, so I suggested he make pies and oven-bakes to demonstrate how to use some of the ingredients. Our spinach pies (Spanakopita) became so popular that we were asked to supply a local caf\\u00e9, whose clientele would also queue up to buy them.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0Anne and Yannis winning Quality Food Award for their Cretan Graviera Cheese\\u00a0I love Crete, its natural beauty, its people and its food.

London was full of action, new experiences and interesting people, but I was always missing something that was deep within me \\u2013 nature.During the next year I left my finance career and moved back to Lithuania, where I immersed myself in my Baltic heritage. I turned to the deep roots of my ancestors and learned the real honey traditions passed down by generations of beekeepers. My aim was to bring a spoonful of unspoilt nature to our fast-paced modern world, and that\\u2019s how Bee Baltic was born.Baltic bees roam wild meadows and woodlands filled with native wildflowers, linden blossoms and wild buckwheat to make deliciously healthy, sweet honey. Our job is to provide them with a safe and ethical environment to thrive in.But due to 21st century\\u2019s extreme use of pesticides, pollution and expansion of big cities, bees are on a steep decline all around the world. And as they pollinate about 70% of all food crops, bees are crucial to our environment.That\\u2019s why Bee Baltic works with a selection of small-scale local beekeepers, including the owner Paul, that promote ethical beekeeping practices. Through our bee products, you can support the sustainable and responsible beekeeping, which will help to save the bees.\\\"Just like my grandfather passed on the love of bees to me, so is Bee Baltic sharing the goodness of real honey with you.\\\" - Paul, Chief\\u00a0Beekeeper at Bee Baltic.Thanks to mother nature, we can offer you honey in its most natural form - unprocessed, unpasteurised, and 100% raw. Unlike shop bought honey, raw honey is completely free of antibiotics and pesticides. It\\u2019s naturally antibacterial and is a great supplement to your diet.All of our honey is gently filtered by hand to remove any large solids to make it into a heavenly golden liquid. Unlike industrialised heat treatment and filtering, the traditional preparation method of honey keeps all the natural nutritional properties.Due to the natural process of glucose separating from water, raw honey will crystallise as time goes by. While many people believe that this is a sign of honey going bad, it\\u2019s quite the opposite. The crystallisation process is a sign that your honey is natural, without added sugar syrups and heat treatments.Read more about raw honeySustainable and ethical beekeeping practices is what Bee Baltic stands for. We take great pride in our traditional beekeeping methods. As a result, our bees are cared for with natural healing remedies, which are free from any antibiotics. Our honey is tested at a certified laboratory to meet the standards of 100% raw and natural honey.We deeply care for the bees and their existence.

      "Yannis Borakis tells “When I first came to England over 30 years ago, there was a lot about the British diet I loved: apple pies and custard, fish and chips, Sunday roasts, cream teas, bangers and mash! But I really missed my olive oil and just couldn’t find anything in the supermarkets that came close to what I was used to \n",
      "In Crete, we use lots and lots of olive oil \n",
      "We use it in all our cooking, not just on salads, we even use it in our cakes and pastry – and to cook chips! It’s much more than a cooking oil, it’s a flavouring ingredient, just like salt and pepper, herbs or lemon juice, and the main reason why the Cretan diet is so healthy \n",
      "I started importing my own olive oil from my father’s farm, a barrel at a time (we do consume rather a lot!) \n",
      "Pretty soon friends who came to eat with us were asking me if they could buy some from me \n",
      "I decided to have it bottled and imported it to sell in the UK \n",
      "My family has been farming for generations in the White mountains of North-western Crete \n",
      "After success with the olive oil, I asked my Uncle to send me some of our traditional cheeses \n",
      "These are all produced from goat and sheep milk (there are no cows on Crete!) and hand-made according to traditional methods \n",
      "I then asked my brother, who keeps bees to send me honey \n",

      "During the next year I left my finance career and moved back to Lithuania, where I immersed myself in my Baltic heritage \n",
      "I turned to the deep roots of my ancestors and learned the real honey traditions passed down by generations of beekeepers \n",
      "My aim was to bring a spoonful of unspoilt nature to our fast-paced modern world, and that’s how Bee Baltic was born \n",
      "Baltic bees roam wild meadows and woodlands filled with native wildflowers, linden blossoms and wild buckwheat to make deliciously healthy, sweet honey \n",
      "Our job is to provide them with a safe and ethical environment to thrive in \n",
      "But due to 21st century’s extreme use of pesticides, pollution and expansion of big cities, bees are on a steep decline all around the world \n",
      "And as they pollinate about 70% of all food crops, bees are crucial to our environment \n",
