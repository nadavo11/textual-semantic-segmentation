This natural product can help with a huge variety of health conditions in adults, children and animals. It\\u2019s known to be effective against 650 strains of bacteria, viruses and fungi, and is well-known for its skin healing properties if made correctly. \\u00a0Colloidal Silver is also the key ingredient in our topical products which means we don\\u2019t have to use any nasty artificial preservatives or parabens, so you can rest assured our products are as natural and safe as they can be.                       An ancient remedy                     Silver as a natural treatment is nothing new. As far back as Ancient Greece, they used a silver coin in a barrel of water to stop bacteria growing. Since then, it has been used throughout the ages to fight infection, in everything from hospitals to water systems.In the early 20th Century, colloidal silver was used by doctors as it proved enormously effective against bacteria. Its use declined after 1938 when antibiotics were introduced. However, not even 100 years on and we are seeing resistance to antibiotics, and since the 70s there has been a renewed interest in Colloidal Silver.Nowadays, NASA uses a silver water system in its space shuttles, and many airlines use silver water filters. Silver is also used by hospitals in burns units and to dress wounds, as well as being used in public buildings in the UK to prevent Legionnaires disease and bacteria.Curious to know more?Delve into the history of silver here\\u201cSilver has been used for centuries. Hippocrates wrote about the use of silver in wound care\\u2026 WW1 soldiers used silver leaf to treat infected wounds.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0                       Using it today                     Use it daily to enhance your body\\u2019s immune system, or as a first aid remedy to naturally fight infection, ailments and skin concerns. It\\u2019s also used by those with illnesses or skin conditions that cannot be treated conventionally, or who want an alternative to modern drugs.\\u201cOnce people discover our products, they find they can use them to help with so many things, and the products become a staple part of the family first aid kit.\\u201d\\u00a0 Lucy Roberts, Managing Director, Active Silver                       How does it work?                     Like with anything in life, nature seeks to be balanced, or neutral. Our bodies contain both good and bad bacteria. \\u2018Good\\u2019 bacteria helps our bodies to function and provides a balance, having equal amounts of positive and negative electrical charges (ions).\\u2018Bad\\u2019 bacteria is unbalanced because it has more negative than positive ions. Each of the silver particles in our Colloidal Silver is positively charged using our advanced electrolysis technique. Once ingested or in contact with skin, these particles are attracted to the spare negative ions in \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria. The Colloidal Silver rips these negative ions away, causing the \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria to die. The silver is then cleared out of the body by the immune, lymphatic and elimination systems.It's impossible for bacteria to build up a resistance to Colloidal Silver. Providing the right concentration and particle size has been used, the Colloidal Silver is rapidly absorbed into the upper gastrointestinal tract, leaving little to interact with the beneficial \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria in our intestines.Antibiotics kill the \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria that is so vital for our gut. This, coupled with the growing resistance to modern antibiotics, encourages more people to turn to Colloidal Silver. Interestingly, Colloidal Silver actually helps to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics too.                       What can Colloidal Silver be used for?                     Abscess, Acne, Allergies, Asthma, Athletes Foot, Bites, Bladder infections, Boils, Bronchitis, Burns, Candida albicans (thrush), Catarrh, Chicken Pox, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Colds, Congestion, Conjunctivitis, Coughs, Cuts, Cysts, Cystitis, Dandruff, Dermatitis, Ear infections, Eczema, Eye infections, Gastrointestinal distress, Headaches, Herpes virus, Influenza, Intestinal disorders, Legionnaires disease, Lesions, Molluscum, Pneumonia, Prickly Heat, Prostate disorders, Psoriasis, Rhinitis, Ringworm, Rosacea, Scars, Shingles, Sinusitis, Skin irritations and issues, Sores, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus infections, Sunburn, Sun spots, Thyroid conditions, Toothache, Tonsillitis, Ulcers, Verrucas, Warts, Yeast infections\\u2026 and much more.Colloidal Silver can also be used as disinfectant around the home, and on animals too.

Until his untimely death from cancer in 2016 at age 40, Chili lived in British Columbia\\u2019s Coast Mountains and pulled artistic inspiration from his time spent exploring the mountains, forests, and coastline of his home.\\u201cExperience is an important part of my painting,\\u201d Chili said. \\u201cWhen I watch a sunset\\u2014all those super-saturated colours giving in to the dark of night\\u2014I want to condense the colours and the feeling of the whole experience and passage of time rather than just catch one specific instant.\\u201dThe linear brush strokes and deftly layered colours in Chili\\u2019s work helped him translate the motion and feeling of a landscape. He connected with the paintings of the Group of Seven\\u2014particularly Tom Thomson\\u2014 and his most recent favourite artist was Alphonse Mucha, but the primary driving force of Chili\\u2019s art was the natural world\\u2014water, wind and, notably, snow.\\u201cAs a white, snow reflects any and every color. Plus, it forms more abstract shapes, or it can blow around. If you spend enough time in the backcountry you will see snow in almost every color and shape. Snow gives a lot of freedom.\\u201d\\u201cNot a single colour goes onto my canvass without some tweaking,\\u201d Chili explained. \\u201cAnyone can paint straight from the tube.\\u201dA trained wilderness guide, Chili originally turned to photography tried to capture the incredible landscapes and unique moments of natural beauty he would witness while exploring the mountains, forests, and coastlines of British Columbia.\\u201cBut I couldn\\u2019t get it,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cA photo captures a tiny sliver of a moment, but I wanted to get that feeling of being there for the entire sunset. The way the clouds move, or the wind blowing through. I found that by going back to painting I could bring a bit of the magic of spending time in nature back home with me.\\u201dAs his talent became more well known, Chili was able to retire from guiding and start adventuring solely for his own purposes (with a one-year stint as star/head guide of Wild At Heart, a television program that saw Chili take people with limited outdoor experience into some of British Columbias most heralded provincial parks).Adventures to Mexico, Nicaragua, Ireland, and Europe inspired Chili with inspiring new natural vistas (particularly ocean waves) and styles to experiment with but his heart remained bound to his homeland of beautiful British Columbia.\\u201cChili\\u2019s paintings result from experiencing the outdoors in a way that only someone who has camped on top of a mountain in the middle of winter can have experienced,\\u201d says Adrian Raeside, an author, artist and syndicated cartoonist who was also one of Chili\\u2019s early collectors. \\u201cHe uses colour to create a mood in ways that no other artist can pull off. After seeing a Chili landscape, you'll never look at nature the same again.\\u201dBut, Chili hoped, you will want to look at more of it.High In The Mountainswith Chili ThomChili offset his time at the easel or out venturing in the wilds with a social enthusiasm that touched thousands. He was an accomplished DJ (check this mix of funky breaks), a renegade DIY filmmaker (and co-founder of Whistler\\u2019s infamous Heavy Hitting HorrorFest) , an event creator (he took on the role of Artistic Director of the Athlete\\u2019s Parade for the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Paralympic Games in Whistler, BC).After he passed over to the other side, the community of Whistler honoured Chili\\u2019s legacy with The Chili Thom Experience, a 30-day, seven-venue celebration of his life and work highlighted by a Masterpieces exhibition at the prestigious Audain Art Museum.

It\\u2019s known to be effective against 650 strains of bacteria, viruses and fungi, and is well-known for its skin healing properties if made correctly. \\u00a0Colloidal Silver is also the key ingredient in our topical products which means we don\\u2019t have to use any nasty artificial preservatives or parabens, so you can rest assured our products are as natural and safe as they can be.                       An ancient remedy                     Silver as a natural treatment is nothing new. As far back as Ancient Greece, they used a silver coin in a barrel of water to stop bacteria growing. Since then, it has been used throughout the ages to fight infection, in everything from hospitals to water systems.In the early 20th Century, colloidal silver was used by doctors as it proved enormously effective against bacteria. Its use declined after 1938 when antibiotics were introduced. However, not even 100 years on and we are seeing resistance to antibiotics, and since the 70s there has been a renewed interest in Colloidal Silver.Nowadays, NASA uses a silver water system in its space shuttles, and many airlines use silver water filters. Silver is also used by hospitals in burns units and to dress wounds, as well as being used in public buildings in the UK to prevent Legionnaires disease and bacteria.Curious to know more?Delve into the history of silver here\\u201cSilver has been used for centuries.

Like with anything in life, nature seeks to be balanced, or neutral. Our bodies contain both good and bad bacteria. \\u2018Good\\u2019 bacteria helps our bodies to function and provides a balance, having equal amounts of positive and negative electrical charges (ions).\\u2018Bad\\u2019 bacteria is unbalanced because it has more negative than positive ions. Each of the silver particles in our Colloidal Silver is positively charged using our advanced electrolysis technique. Once ingested or in contact with skin, these particles are attracted to the spare negative ions in \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria. The Colloidal Silver rips these negative ions away, causing the \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria to die. The silver is then cleared out of the body by the immune, lymphatic and elimination systems.It's impossible for bacteria to build up a resistance to Colloidal Silver. Providing the right concentration and particle size has been used, the Colloidal Silver is rapidly absorbed into the upper gastrointestinal tract, leaving little to interact with the beneficial \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria in our intestines.Antibiotics kill the \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria that is so vital for our gut. This, coupled with the growing resistance to modern antibiotics, encourages more people to turn to Colloidal Silver. Interestingly, Colloidal Silver actually helps to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics too.                       What can Colloidal Silver be used for?

            "This natural product can help with a huge variety of health conditions in adults, children and animals.\n",
            "It’s known to be effective against 650 strains of bacteria, viruses and fungi, and is well-known for its skin healing properties if made correctly.\n",
            "Colloidal Silver is also the key ingredient in our topical products which means we don’t have to use any nasty artificial preservatives or parabens, so you can rest assured our products are as natural and safe as they can be.\n",
            "An ancient remedy                     Silver as a natural treatment is nothing new.\n",
            "As far back as Ancient Greece, they used a silver coin in a barrel of water to stop bacteria growing.\n",
            "Since then, it has been used throughout the ages to fight infection, in everything from hospitals to water systems.In the early 20th Century, colloidal silver was used by doctors as it proved enormously effective against bacteria.\n",
            "Its use declined after 1938 when antibiotics were introduced.\n",
            "However, not even 100 years on and we are seeing resistance to antibiotics, and since the 70s there has been a renewed interest in Colloidal Silver.Nowadays, NASA uses a silver water system in its space shuttles, and many airlines use silver water filters.\n",
            "Silver is also used by hospitals in burns units and to dress wounds, as well as being used in public buildings in the UK to prevent Legionnaires disease and bacteria.Curious to know more?Delve into the history of silver here“Silver has been used for centuries.\n",
            "Hippocrates wrote about the use of silver in wound care… WW1 soldiers used silver leaf to treat infected wounds.”                            Using it today                     Use it daily to enhance your body’s immune system, or as a first aid remedy to naturally fight infection, ailments and skin concerns.\n",
            "It’s also used by those with illnesses or skin conditions that cannot be treated conventionally, or who want an alternative to modern drugs.“Once people discover our products, they find they can use them to help with so many things, and the products become a staple part of the family first aid kit.”  Lucy Roberts, Managing Director, Active Silver                       How does it work?\n",
            "Like with anything in life, nature seeks to be balanced, or neutral.\n",
            "Our bodies contain both good and bad bacteria.\n",
            "‘Good’ bacteria helps our bodies to function and provides a balance, having equal amounts of positive and negative electrical charges (ions).‘Bad’ bacteria is unbalanced because it has more negative than positive ions.\n",
            "Each of the silver particles in our Colloidal Silver is positively charged using our advanced electrolysis technique.\n",
            "Once ingested or in contact with skin, these particles are attracted to the spare negative ions in ‘bad’ bacteria.\n",
            "The Colloidal Silver rips these negative ions away, causing the ‘bad’ bacteria to die.\n",
            "The silver is then cleared out of the body by the immune, lymphatic and elimination systems.It's impossible for bacteria to build up a resistance to Colloidal Silver.\n",
            "Providing the right concentration and particle size has been used, the Colloidal Silver is rapidly absorbed into the upper gastrointestinal tract, leaving little to interact with the beneficial ‘good’ bacteria in our intestines.Antibiotics kill the ‘good’ bacteria that is so vital for our gut.\n",
            "This, coupled with the growing resistance to modern antibiotics, encourages more people to turn to Colloidal Silver.\n",
            "Interestingly, Colloidal Silver actually helps to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics too.\n",
            "What can Colloidal Silver be used for?\n",
            "Abscess, Acne, Allergies, Asthma, Athletes Foot, Bites, Bladder infections, Boils, Bronchitis, Burns, Candida albicans (thrush), Catarrh, Chicken Pox, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Colds, Congestion, Conjunctivitis, Coughs, Cuts, Cysts, Cystitis, Dandruff, Dermatitis, Ear infections, Eczema, Eye infections, Gastrointestinal distress, Headaches, Herpes virus, Influenza, Intestinal disorders, Legionnaires disease, Lesions, Molluscum, Pneumonia, Prickly Heat, Prostate disorders, Psoriasis, Rhinitis, Ringworm, Rosacea, Scars, Shingles, Sinusitis, Skin irritations and issues, Sores, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus infections, Sunburn, Sun spots, Thyroid conditions, Toothache, Tonsillitis, Ulcers, Verrucas, Warts, Yeast infections… and much more.Colloidal Silver can also be used as disinfectant around the home,\n",

            "time spent exploring the mountains, forests, and coastline of his home.“Experience is an important part of my painting,” Chili said.\n",
            "Until his untimely death from cancer in 2016 at age 40, Chili lived in British Columbia’s Coast Mountains and pulled artistic inspiration from his time spent exploring the mountains, forests, and coastline of his home.“Experience is an important part of my painting,” Chili said.\n",
            "“When I watch a sunset—all those super-saturated colours giving in to the dark of night—I want to condense the colours and the feeling of the whole experience and passage of time rather than just catch one specific instant.”The linear brush strokes and deftly layered colours in Chili’s work helped him translate the motion and feeling of a landscape.\n",
            "He connected with the paintings of the Group of Seven—particularly Tom Thomson— and his most recent favourite artist was Alphonse Mucha, but the primary driving force of Chili’s art was the natural world—water, wind and, notably, snow.“As a white, snow reflects any and every color.\n",
            "Plus, it forms more abstract shapes, or it can blow around.\n",
            "If you spend enough time in the backcountry you will see snow in almost every color and shape.\n",
            "Snow gives a lot of freedom.”“Not a single colour goes onto my canvass without some tweaking,” Chili explained.\n",
            "“Anyone can paint straight from the tube.”A trained wilderness guide, Chili originally turned to photography tried to capture the incredible landscapes and unique moments of natural beauty he would witness while exploring the mountains, forests, and coastlines of British Columbia.“But I couldn’t get it,” he explained.\n",
            "“A photo captures a tiny sliver of a moment, but I wanted to get that feeling of being there for the entire sunset.\n",
            "The way the clouds move, or the wind blowing through.\n",
            "I found that by going back to painting I could bring a bit of the magic of spending time in nature back home with me.”As his talent became more well known, Chili was able to retire from guiding and start adventuring solely for his own purposes (with a one-year stint as star/head guide of Wild At Heart, a television program that saw Chili take people with limited outdoor experience into some of British Columbias most heralded provincial parks).Adventures to Mexico, Nicaragua, Ireland, and Europe inspired Chili with inspiring new natural vistas (particularly ocean waves) and styles to experiment with but his heart remained bound to his homeland of beautiful British Columbia.“Chili’s paintings result from experiencing the outdoors in a way that only someone who has camped on top of a mountain in the middle of winter can have experienced,” says Adrian Raeside, an author, artist and syndicated cartoonist who was also one of Chili’s early collectors.\n",
            "“He uses colour to create a mood in ways that no other artist can pull off.\n",
            "After seeing a Chili landscape, you'll never look at nature the same again.”But, Chili hoped, you will want to look at more of it.High In The Mountainswith Chili ThomChili offset his time at the easel or out venturing in the wilds with a social enthusiasm that touched thousands.\n",
            "He was an accomplished DJ (check this mix of funky breaks), a renegade DIY filmmaker (and co-founder of Whistler’s infamous Heavy Hitting HorrorFest) , an event creator (he took on the role of Artistic Director of the Athlete’s Parade for the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Paralympic Games in Whistler, BC).After he passed over to the other side, the community of Whistler honoured Chili’s legacy with The Chili Thom Experience, a 30-day, seven-venue celebration of his life and work highlighted by a Masterpieces exhibition at the prestigious Audain Art Museum.\n",
            "The event established  memorial scholarship fund to annually support young artists in all four communities of Chili’s Sea to Sky home turf (Squamish, Whistler, Pemberton, Mount Currie).Chili’s family and friends continue to run his art business, ensuring fans around the globe can bring some of Chili’s unique perspective on the outdoor world into their homes and lives.\n",
            "As per Chili’s last wishes, all proceeds from art sales are held in trust for his daughter, who was threeyears old when he passed, with annual donations to children’s art and nature preservation charities that were close to his heart.\n",

            "These were challenging times and yet very exciting for it was the first time that I was running my own business.Then we returned to Japan in 2010 and over the next four years I participated in many fascinating arts and crafts trade shows of varying sizes.\n",
            "Eventually, another opportunity was given to us and we decided to return to the states.\n",

            "It is not just another product with a “theoretical” formulation.\n",
            "The thing that makes this product unique is that it was designed using actual results from lab tested blood work.\n",
            "When the product was being designed, blood work was taken by participants with lab results outside of healthy ranges.\n",
            "After taking the product for one month their blood work was taken again to see improvements.\n",
            "Based on those results the ingredients and dosages were changed and then tested by blood work again.\n",
            "The formulation was modified through this process until it reached a point that the participant’s lab results improved drastically while taking the FIX daily.\n",
            "The original purpose of designing the FIX was based on the fact that the FDA does not regulate the supplement industry, resulting in the majority of products on the market being very underdosed.\n",
            "Before the FIX was created, this same testing process was done on the participants while taking other supplements that claimed to improve health.\n",
            "Out of 20 products tested during this process, only two of them minorly improved the lab results.\n",
            "The dosages shown in clinical studies that improve health, lab work, organ function, blood pressure, blood sugar, and circulation are typically between 10 – 20 times more than the numbers the majority of products put on their nutritional label.\n",
            "This is why little to no results are seen when taking most of the products available on the market.\n",
            "The FIX has 16 active ingredients with a serving size of 12 tablets twice daily.\n",
            "That is a lot more than the typical serving size of 1 – 3 tablets daily seen in most products.\n",
            "The amounts needed to see results will not fit into a dose that small.\n",
            "Another reason the FIX is unique is its designed to have multiple benefits, and not just one.\n",
            "Most products claim to improve just 1 or 2 aspects of your health.\n",
            "The FIX was designed to:Important: The FIX can start attacking toxins very quickly, so it is essential to follow the recommended 10-day loading phase when beginning to take this product.\n",
            "When toxins are released too quickly it can cause nausea, much like the feeling after a deep tissue massage that breaks down and releases toxins.\n",

            "As a handyman, it became apparent to me that there was a lack of choice in the current market for industrial, reliable, and accurate laser levels at a price accessible to most.When I started working on my home renovations I found laser levels to be an absolute necessity but my old red beam laser was hard to see, quick to die, and hardly functional.\n",
            "I found some other quality lasers online that suited my needs but were extremely expensive and not quite as functional as the price entailed.I have engineered the Intice intelligent laser level to be as functional, heavy duty, affordable, and easy to use as could possibly be.Created in 2019 by owner Aaron Piete.\n",
            "Intice has grown from a faint idea, into one of the fastest growing laser level businesses today.Now trusted by over 10,000 satisfied customers worldwide, Intice is utilized in many different projects from home renovation to professional trades.\n",
            "This growth comes from a devotion to producing innovative, effective, and time-saving products, because we know, life goes fast so whenever saving time is possible we would like to do so.Before there is an action, there is an idea.We exist to create the tools that help people unlock their full, incredible potential and put their ideas into action.Pronounced In-tice, the Intice Intelligent Laser Level Kit is the best-in-class german engineered green beam, self-leveling laser level kit.\n",
            "The Intice intelligent laser level is a chalk line, spirit level, and plumb bob all combined in one.\n",
            "With a single click of a button, you can be up and running in seconds.The Intice Intelligent Laser level can plumb, align, square, and level which makes it your perfect companion for virtually any project.\n",
            "With a handy padded carrying case encasing many mounts ranging from a rotating magnetic wall bracket, a one-of-a-kind micro-control floor lift, and our signature tripod there isn’t a single spot that can’t be hit.\n",
            "“A little over two years ago, I set out to build a company that makes high-quality laser leveling and measuring tools.\n",
            "The idea is simple and straightforward, but the passion behind the business runs much deeper.\n",
            "Growing up in a Do-it-yourself focused household, I spent my teenage year's roofing, landscaping, and building alongside my father while learning all about tools and their uses.\n",
            "I went off to early college to pursue my interest in business, but many of my high school peers went right into the trades.\n",
            "Early in their careers they were all making a solid living, had no debt or college loans, owned homes, and were starting to build and support families of their own.\n",
            "They remain some of my best friends today and a huge part of why I've put so much energy into building Intice.Intice is reinventing the laser tool realm, starting from the ground up with levels and distance measurers.Initially, we spent a lot of time researching and studying side-by-side with my friends in the trades obsessing over how to engineer products and solutions that make real handyman’s lives easier; so you can focus your time and energy on the things that truly matter, and ignore the things that don’t.Next, we solved the biggest problem – unnecessary retail store mark-ups that take your hard-earned money right out of your pocket.\n",
            "By selling directly to you online, we cut out the retail mark-ups - inventory - store rent, utilities, and other costs that come with them.\n",
            "Even though my friends definitely have the capital to buy any tools on the market, they shouldn't be overpaying for the tools they use on a daily - guys like them are the backbone of this country, and they deserve more.”- Aaron Piete.\n",

            "Crispy is a delicious texture, but not for hair.\n",
            "Then one day I came across the multitude of benefits granted by the natural fibre of silk.Firstly, I tried a silk pillowcase. Wonderful.\n",
            "It was the middle of summer and I found I didn't play \"flip the pillow\" all night to enjoy the cooler side like you do with a regular old cotton pillowcase.\n",
            "I also noticed my hair after just one night was no longer 'crispy'.But I still had a problem; the length of my hair.\n",
            "Any woman with long hair knows that when it gets to a certain length - usually when it starts to get caught in your underarms - you must tie your hair up before you go to bed.This then caused problem 2.1: hair tie creases in the morning and even worse; over time you end up with major breakage on the underside of your hair and an abundance of awful wispy flyaways!So I had this idea... at least, I thought it was my idea until a quick Google almost completely burst my bubble; cocoon my hair in silk.\n",
            "Keep my unruly locks contained so they can't inadvertently strangle me in the night, and wake with fabulous silky smooth hair in the morning!\n",
            "But as it turned out, a silk sleep cap was already a thing.\n",
            "However, in my opinion, it was too expensive a thing (and in some instances, slightly too ugly a thing) for me to get on board with.\n",
            "So I decided to do my own thing and bring a range of beautiful, high-quality silk pillowcases and silk sleep caps to the market at a much nicer price.\n",
            "Oh and I also felt the colours were all pretty blah, so I included the gorgeous Mono Leopard colourway in the sleep cap range and will add more to the collection over time.So here I am, sitting here typing this About Us/Me page with hair in the best condition of its life hoping that you'll try a Halo silk pillowcase and sleep cap for yourself and then message to thank me for changing your life - or at least just for not having to wash your hair as often and for all the extra time you have in the morning because you just woke up like that.\n",

Until his untimely death from cancer in 2016 at age 40, Chili lived in British Columbia\\u2019s Coast Mountains and pulled artistic inspiration from his time spent exploring the mountains, forests, and coastline of his home.\\u201cExperience is an important part of my painting,\\u201d Chili said. \\u201cWhen I watch a sunset\\u2014all those super-saturated colours giving in to the dark of night\\u2014I want to condense the colours and the feeling of the whole experience and passage of time rather than just catch one specific instant.\\u201dThe linear brush strokes and deftly layered colours in Chili\\u2019s work helped him translate the motion and feeling of a landscape. He connected with the paintings of the Group of Seven\\u2014particularly Tom Thomson\\u2014 and his most recent favourite artist was Alphonse Mucha, but the primary driving force of Chili\\u2019s art was the natural world\\u2014water, wind and, notably, snow.\\u201cAs a white, snow reflects any and every color. Plus, it forms more abstract shapes, or it can blow around. If you spend enough time in the backcountry you will see snow in almost every color and shape. Snow gives a lot of freedom.\\u201d\\u201cNot a single colour goes onto my canvass without some tweaking,\\u201d Chili explained. \\u201cAnyone can paint straight from the tube.\\u201dA trained wilderness guide, Chili originally turned to photography tried to capture the incredible landscapes and unique moments of natural beauty he would witness while exploring the mountains, forests, and coastlines of British Columbia.\\u201cBut I couldn\\u2019t get it,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cA photo captures a tiny sliver of a moment, but I wanted to get that feeling of being there for the entire sunset. The way the clouds move, or the wind blowing through. I found that by going back to painting I could bring a bit of the magic of spending time in nature back home with me.\\u201dAs his talent became more well known, Chili was able to retire from guiding and start adventuring solely for his own purposes (with a one-year stint as star/head guide of Wild At Heart, a television program that saw Chili take people with limited outdoor experience into some of British Columbias most heralded provincial parks).Adventures to Mexico, Nicaragua, Ireland, and Europe inspired Chili with inspiring new natural vistas (particularly ocean waves) and styles to experiment with but his heart remained bound to his homeland of beautiful British Columbia.\\u201cChili\\u2019s paintings result from experiencing the outdoors in a way that only someone who has camped on top of a mountain in the middle of winter can have experienced,\\u201d says Adrian Raeside, an author, artist and syndicated cartoonist who was also one of Chili\\u2019s early collectors. \\u201cHe uses colour to create a mood in ways that no other artist can pull off. After seeing a Chili landscape, you'll never look at nature the same again.\\u201dBut, Chili hoped, you will want to look at more of it.High In The Mountainswith Chili ThomChili offset his time at the easel or out venturing in the wilds with a social enthusiasm that touched thousands. He was an accomplished DJ (check this mix of funky breaks), a renegade DIY filmmaker (and co-founder of Whistler\\u2019s infamous Heavy Hitting HorrorFest) , an event creator (he took on the role of Artistic Director of the Athlete\\u2019s Parade for the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Paralympic Games in Whistler, BC).After he passed over to the other side, the community of Whistler honoured Chili\\u2019s legacy with The Chili Thom Experience, a 30-day, seven-venue celebration of his life and work highlighted by a Masterpieces exhibition at the prestigious Audain Art Museum.

It\\u2019s known to be effective against 650 strains of bacteria, viruses and fungi, and is well-known for its skin healing properties if made correctly. \\u00a0Colloidal Silver is also the key ingredient in our topical products which means we don\\u2019t have to use any nasty artificial preservatives or parabens, so you can rest assured our products are as natural and safe as they can be.                       An ancient remedy                     Silver as a natural treatment is nothing new. As far back as Ancient Greece, they used a silver coin in a barrel of water to stop bacteria growing. Since then, it has been used throughout the ages to fight infection, in everything from hospitals to water systems.In the early 20th Century, colloidal silver was used by doctors as it proved enormously effective against bacteria. Its use declined after 1938 when antibiotics were introduced. However, not even 100 years on and we are seeing resistance to antibiotics, and since the 70s there has been a renewed interest in Colloidal Silver.Nowadays, NASA uses a silver water system in its space shuttles, and many airlines use silver water filters. Silver is also used by hospitals in burns units and to dress wounds, as well as being used in public buildings in the UK to prevent Legionnaires disease and bacteria.Curious to know more?Delve into the history of silver here\\u201cSilver has been used for centuries.

Like with anything in life, nature seeks to be balanced, or neutral. Our bodies contain both good and bad bacteria. \\u2018Good\\u2019 bacteria helps our bodies to function and provides a balance, having equal amounts of positive and negative electrical charges (ions).\\u2018Bad\\u2019 bacteria is unbalanced because it has more negative than positive ions. Each of the silver particles in our Colloidal Silver is positively charged using our advanced electrolysis technique. Once ingested or in contact with skin, these particles are attracted to the spare negative ions in \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria. The Colloidal Silver rips these negative ions away, causing the \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria to die. The silver is then cleared out of the body by the immune, lymphatic and elimination systems.It's impossible for bacteria to build up a resistance to Colloidal Silver. Providing the right concentration and particle size has been used, the Colloidal Silver is rapidly absorbed into the upper gastrointestinal tract, leaving little to interact with the beneficial \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria in our intestines.Antibiotics kill the \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria that is so vital for our gut. This, coupled with the growing resistance to modern antibiotics, encourages more people to turn to Colloidal Silver. Interestingly, Colloidal Silver actually helps to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics too.                       What can Colloidal Silver be used for?

exploring the mountains, forests, and coastline of his home.\\u201cExperience is an important part of my painting,\\u201d Chili said. \\n\\u201cWhen I watch a sunset\\u2014all those super-saturated colours giving in to the dark of night\\u2014I want to condense the colours and the feeling of the whole experience and passage of time rather than just catch one specific instant.\\u201dThe linear brush strokes and deftly layered colours in Chili\\u2019s work helped him translate the motion and feeling of a landscape. \\nHe connected with the paintings of the Group of Seven\\u2014particularly Tom Thomson\\u2014 and his most recent favourite artist was Alphonse Mucha, but the primary driving force of Chili\\u2019s art was the natural world\\u2014water, wind and, notably, snow.\\u201cAs a white, snow reflects any and every color. \\nPlus, it forms more abstract shapes, or it can blow around. \\nIf you spend enough time in the backcountry you will see snow in almost every color and shape. \\nSnow gives a lot of freedom.\\u201d\\u201cNot a single colour goes onto my canvass without some tweaking,\\u201d Chili explained. \\n\\u201cAnyone can paint straight from the tube.\\u201dA trained wilderness guide, Chili originally turned to photography tried to capture the incredible landscapes and unique moments of natural beauty he would witness while exploring the mountains, forests, and coastlines of British Columbia.\\u201cBut I couldn\\u2019t get it,\\u201d he explained. \\n\\u201cA photo captures a tiny sliver of a moment, but I wanted to get that feeling of being there for the entire sunset. \\nThe way the clouds move, or the wind blowing through. \\nI found that by going back to painting I could bring a bit of the magic of spending time in nature back home with me.\\u201dAs his talent became more well known, Chili was able to retire from guiding and start adventuring solely for his own purposes (with a one-year stint as star/head guide of Wild At Heart, a television program that saw Chili take people with limited outdoor experience into some of British Columbias most heralded provincial parks).Adventures to Mexico, Nicaragua, Ireland, and Europe inspired Chili with inspiring new natural vistas (particularly ocean waves) and styles to experiment with but his heart remained bound to his homeland of beautiful British Columbia.\\u201cChili\\u2019s paintings result from experiencing the outdoors in a way that only someone who has camped on top of a mountain in the middle of winter can have experienced,\\u201d says Adrian Raeside, an author, artist and syndicated cartoonist who was also one of Chili\\u2019s early collectors. \\nAfter seeing a Chili landscape, you'll never look at nature the same again.\\u201dBut, Chili hoped, you will want to look at more of it.High In The Mountainswith Chili ThomChili offset his time at the easel or out venturing in the wilds with a social enthusiasm that touched thousands. \\nHe was an accomplished DJ (check this mix of funky breaks), a renegade DIY filmmaker (and co-founder of Whistler\\u2019s infamous Heavy Hitting HorrorFest) , an event creator (he took on the role of Artistic Director of the Athlete\\u2019s Parade for the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Paralympic Games in Whistler, BC).After he passed over to the other side, the community of Whistler honoured Chili\\u2019s legacy with The Chili Thom Experience, a 30-day, seven-venue celebration of his life and work highlighted by a Masterpieces exhibition at the prestigious Audain Art Museum. \\nThe event established  memorial scholarship fund to annually support young artists in all four communities of Chili\\u2019s Sea to Sky home turf (Squamish, Whistler, Pemberton, Mount Currie).Chili\\u2019s family and friends continue to run his art business, ensuring fans around the globe can bring some of Chili\\u2019s unique perspective on the outdoor world into their homes and lives. \\nAs per Chili\\u2019s last wishes, all proceeds from art sales are held in trust for his daughter, who was threeyears old when he passed, with annual donations to children\\u2019s art and nature preservation charities that were close to his heart. \\nShipping & taxes calculated at checkout\",\n          \"Country/regionCountry/region                       A powerful natural treatment                     Colloidal Silver is a liquid made of nano sized silver particles, suspended in ultra-pure water. \\nThis natural product can help with a huge variety of health conditions in adults, children and animals. \\nIt\\u2019s known to be effective against 650 strains of bacteria, viruses and fungi, and is well-known for its skin healing properties if made correctly. \\nColloidal Silver is also the key ingredient in our topical products which means we don\\u2019t have to use any nasty artificial preservatives or parabens, so you can rest assured our products are as natural and safe as they can be. \\nAn ancient remedy                     Silver as a natural treatment is nothing new. \\nAs far back as Ancient Greece, they used a silver coin in a barrel of water to stop bacteria growing. \\nSince then, it has been used throughout the ages to fight infection, in everything from hospitals to water systems.In the early 20th Century, colloidal silver was used by doctors as it proved enormously effective against bacteria. \\nIts use declined after 1938 when antibiotics were introduced. \\nHowever, not even 100 years on and we are seeing resistance to antibiotics, and since the 70s there has been a renewed interest in Colloidal Silver.Nowadays, NASA uses a silver water system in its space shuttles, and many airlines use silver water filters. \\nSilver is also used by hospitals in burns units and to dress wounds, as well as being used in public buildings in the UK to prevent Legionnaires disease and bacteria.Curious to know more?Delve into the history of silver here\\u201cSilver has been used for centuries. \\nHippocrates wrote about the use of silver in wound care\\u2026 WW1 soldiers used silver leaf to treat infected wounds.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0

they find they can use them to help with so many things, and the products become a staple part of the family first aid kit.\\u201d\\u00a0 Lucy Roberts, Managing Director, Active Silver                       How does it work? \\nLike with anything in life, nature seeks to be balanced, or neutral. \\nOur bodies contain both good and bad bacteria. \\n\\u2018Good\\u2019 bacteria helps our bodies to function and provides a balance, having equal amounts of positive and negative electrical charges (ions).\\u2018Bad\\u2019 bacteria is unbalanced because it has more negative than positive ions. \\nEach of the silver particles in our Colloidal Silver is positively charged using our advanced electrolysis technique. \\nOnce ingested or in contact with skin, these particles are attracted to the spare negative ions in \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria. \\nThe Colloidal Silver rips these negative ions away, causing the \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria to die. \\nThe silver is then cleared out of the body by the immune, lymphatic and elimination systems.It's impossible for bacteria to build up a resistance to Colloidal Silver. \\nProviding the right concentration and particle size has been used, the Colloidal Silver is rapidly absorbed into the upper gastrointestinal tract, leaving little to interact with the beneficial \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria in our intestines.Antibiotics kill the \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria that is so vital for our gut. \\nThis, coupled with the growing resistance to modern antibiotics, encourages more people to turn to Colloidal Silver. \\nInterestingly, Colloidal Silver actually helps to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics too. \\nWhat can Colloidal Silver be used for? \\nAbscess, Acne, Allergies, Asthma, Athletes Foot, Bites, Bladder infections, Boils, Bronchitis, Burns, Candida albicans (thrush), Catarrh, Chicken Pox, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Colds, Congestion, Conjunctivitis, Coughs, Cuts, Cysts, Cystitis, Dandruff, Dermatitis,

            "An ancient remedy                     Silver as a natural treatment is nothing new. \n",
            "As far back as Ancient Greece, they used a silver coin in a barrel of water to stop bacteria growing. \n",
            "Since then, it has been used throughout the ages to fight infection, in everything from hospitals to water systems.In the early 20th Century, colloidal silver was used by doctors as it proved enormously effective against bacteria. \n",
            "Its use declined after 1938 when antibiotics were introduced. \n",
            "However, not even 100 years on and we are seeing resistance to antibiotics, and since the 70s there has been a renewed interest in Colloidal Silver.Nowadays, NASA uses a silver water system in its space shuttles, and many airlines use silver water filters. \n",
            "Silver is also used by hospitals in burns units and to dress wounds, as well as being used in public buildings in the UK to prevent Legionnaires disease and bacteria.Curious to know more?Delve into the history of silver here“Silver has been used for centuries. \n",
            "Hippocrates wrote about the use of silver in wound care… WW1 soldiers used silver leaf to treat infected wounds.”                            Using it today                     Use it daily to enhance your body’s immune system, or as a first aid remedy to naturally fight infection, ailments and skin concerns. \n",

            "Like with anything in life, nature seeks to be balanced, or neutral. \n",
            "Our bodies contain both good and bad bacteria. \n",
            "‘Good’ bacteria helps our bodies to function and provides a balance, having equal amounts of positive and negative electrical charges (ions).‘Bad’ bacteria is unbalanced because it has more negative than positive ions. \n",
            "Each of the silver particles in our Colloidal Silver is positively charged using our advanced electrolysis technique. \n",
            "Once ingested or in contact with skin, these particles are attracted to the spare negative ions in ‘bad’ bacteria. \n",
            "The Colloidal Silver rips these negative ions away, causing the ‘bad’ bacteria to die. \n",
            "The silver is then cleared out of the body by the immune, lymphatic and elimination systems.It's impossible for bacteria to build up a resistance to Colloidal Silver. \n",
            "Providing the right concentration and particle size has been used, the Colloidal Silver is rapidly absorbed into the upper gastrointestinal tract, leaving little to interact with the beneficial ‘good’ bacteria in our intestines.Antibiotics kill the ‘good’ bacteria that is so vital for our gut. \n",
            "This, coupled with the growing resistance to modern antibiotics, encourages more people to turn to Colloidal Silver. \n",

            "Until his untimely death from cancer in 2016 at age 40, Chili lived in British Columbia’s Coast Mountains and pulled artistic inspiration from his time spent exploring the mountains, forests, and coastline of his home.“Experience is an important part of my painting,” Chili said. \n",
            "“When I watch a sunset—all those super-saturated colours giving in to the dark of night—I want to condense the colours and the feeling of the whole experience and passage of time rather than just catch one specific instant.”The linear brush strokes and deftly layered colours in Chili’s work helped him translate the motion and feeling of a landscape. \n",
            "He connected with the paintings of the Group of Seven—particularly Tom Thomson— and his most recent favourite artist was Alphonse Mucha, but the primary driving force of Chili’s art was the natural world—water, wind and, notably, snow.“As a white, snow reflects any and every color. \n",
            "Plus, it forms more abstract shapes, or it can blow around. \n",
            "If you spend enough time in the backcountry you will see snow in almost every color and shape. \n",
            "Snow gives a lot of freedom.”“Not a single colour goes onto my canvass without some tweaking,” Chili explained. \n",
            "“Anyone can paint straight from the tube.”A trained wilderness guide, Chili originally turned to photography tried to capture the incredible landscapes and unique moments of natural beauty he would witness while exploring the mountains, forests, and coastlines of British Columbia.“But I couldn’t get it,” he explained. \n",
            "“A photo captures a tiny sliver of a moment, but I wanted to get that feeling of being there for the entire sunset. \n",
            "The way the clouds move, or the wind blowing through. \n",
            "I found that by going back to painting I could bring a bit of the magic of spending time in nature back home with me.”As his talent became more well known, Chili was able to retire from guiding and start adventuring solely for his own purposes (with a one-year stint as star/head guide of Wild At Heart, a television program that saw Chili take people with limited outdoor experience into some of British Columbias most heralded provincial parks).Adventures to Mexico, Nicaragua, Ireland, and Europe inspired Chili with inspiring new natural vistas (particularly ocean waves) and styles to experiment with but his heart remained bound to his homeland of beautiful British Columbia.“Chili’s paintings result from experiencing the outdoors in a way that only someone who has camped on top of a mountain in the middle of winter can have experienced,” says Adrian Raeside, an author, artist and syndicated cartoonist who was also one of Chili’s early collectors. \n",
            "After seeing a Chili landscape, you'll never look at nature the same again.”But, Chili hoped, you will want to look at more of it.High In The Mountainswith Chili ThomChili offset his time at the easel or out venturing in the wilds with a social enthusiasm that touched thousands. \n",
            "He was an accomplished DJ (check this mix of funky breaks), a renegade DIY filmmaker (and co-founder of Whistler’s infamous Heavy Hitting HorrorFest) , an event creator (he took on the role of Artistic Director of the Athlete’s Parade for the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Paralympic Games in Whistler, BC).After he passed over to the other side, the community of Whistler honoured Chili’s legacy with The Chili Thom Experience, a 30-day, seven-venue celebration of his life and work highlighted by a Masterpieces exhibition at the prestigious Audain Art Museum. \n",

Until his untimely death from cancer in 2016 at age 40, Chili lived in British Columbia\\u2019s Coast Mountains and pulled artistic inspiration from his time spent exploring the mountains, forests, and coastline of his home.\\u201cExperience is an important part of my painting,\\u201d Chili said. \\u201cWhen I watch a sunset\\u2014all those super-saturated colours giving in to the dark of night\\u2014I want to condense the colours and the feeling of the whole experience and passage of time rather than just catch one specific instant.\\u201dThe linear brush strokes and deftly layered colours in Chili\\u2019s work helped him translate the motion and feeling of a landscape. He connected with the paintings of the Group of Seven\\u2014particularly Tom Thomson\\u2014 and his most recent favourite artist was Alphonse Mucha, but the primary driving force of Chili\\u2019s art was the natural world\\u2014water, wind and, notably, snow.\\u201cAs a white, snow reflects any and every color. Plus, it forms more abstract shapes, or it can blow around. If you spend enough time in the backcountry you will see snow in almost every color and shape. Snow gives a lot of freedom.\\u201d\\u201cNot a single colour goes onto my canvass without some tweaking,\\u201d Chili explained. \\u201cAnyone can paint straight from the tube.\\u201dA trained wilderness guide, Chili originally turned to photography tried to capture the incredible landscapes and unique moments of natural beauty he would witness while exploring the mountains, forests, and coastlines of British Columbia.\\u201cBut I couldn\\u2019t get it,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cA photo captures a tiny sliver of a moment, but I wanted to get that feeling of being there for the entire sunset. The way the clouds move, or the wind blowing through. I found that by going back to painting I could bring a bit of the magic of spending time in nature back home with me.\\u201dAs his talent became more well known, Chili was able to retire from guiding and start adventuring solely for his own purposes (with a one-year stint as star/head guide of Wild At Heart, a television program that saw Chili take people with limited outdoor experience into some of British Columbias most heralded provincial parks).Adventures to Mexico, Nicaragua, Ireland, and Europe inspired Chili with inspiring new natural vistas (particularly ocean waves) and styles to experiment with but his heart remained bound to his homeland of beautiful British Columbia.\\u201cChili\\u2019s paintings result from experiencing the outdoors in a way that only someone who has camped on top of a mountain in the middle of winter can have experienced,\\u201d says Adrian Raeside, an author, artist and syndicated cartoonist who was also one of Chili\\u2019s early collectors. \\u201cHe uses colour to create a mood in ways that no other artist can pull off. After seeing a Chili landscape, you'll never look at nature the same again.\\u201dBut, Chili hoped, you will want to look at more of it.High In The Mountainswith Chili ThomChili offset his time at the easel or out venturing in the wilds with a social enthusiasm that touched thousands. He was an accomplished DJ (check this mix of funky breaks), a renegade DIY filmmaker (and co-founder of Whistler\\u2019s infamous Heavy Hitting HorrorFest) , an event creator (he took on the role of Artistic Director of the Athlete\\u2019s Parade for the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Paralympic Games in Whistler, BC).After he passed over to the other side, the community of Whistler honoured Chili\\u2019s legacy with The Chili Thom Experience, a 30-day, seven-venue celebration of his life and work highlighted by a Masterpieces exhibition at the prestigious Audain Art Museum. The event established  memorial scholarship fund to annually support young artists in all four communities of Chili\\u2019s Sea to Sky home turf (Squamish, Whistler, Pemberton, Mount Currie).Chili\\u2019s family and friends continue to run his art business, ensuring fans around the globe can bring some of Chili\\u2019s unique perspective on the outdoor world into their homes and lives. As per Chili\\u2019s last wishes, all proceeds from art sales are held in trust for his daughter, who was threeyears old when he passed, with annual donations to children\\u2019s art and nature preservation charities that were close to his heart.

An ancient remedy                     Silver as a natural treatment is nothing new. As far back as Ancient Greece, they used a silver coin in a barrel of water to stop bacteria growing. Since then, it has been used throughout the ages to fight infection, in everything from hospitals to water systems.In the early 20th Century, colloidal silver was used by doctors as it proved enormously effective against bacteria. Its use declined after 1938 when antibiotics were introduced. However, not even 100 years on and we are seeing resistance to antibiotics, and since the 70s there has been a renewed interest in Colloidal Silver.Nowadays, NASA uses a silver water system in its space shuttles, and many airlines use silver water filters. Silver is also used by hospitals in burns units and to dress wounds, as well as being used in public buildings in the UK to prevent Legionnaires disease and bacteria.Curious to know more?Delve into the history of silver here\\u201cSilver has been used for centuries.

Like with anything in life, nature seeks to be balanced, or neutral. Our bodies contain both good and bad bacteria. \\u2018Good\\u2019 bacteria helps our bodies to function and provides a balance, having equal amounts of positive and negative electrical charges (ions).\\u2018Bad\\u2019 bacteria is unbalanced because it has more negative than positive ions. Each of the silver particles in our Colloidal Silver is positively charged using our advanced electrolysis technique. Once ingested or in contact with skin, these particles are attracted to the spare negative ions in \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria. The Colloidal Silver rips these negative ions away, causing the \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria to die. The silver is then cleared out of the body by the immune, lymphatic and elimination systems.It's impossible for bacteria to build up a resistance to Colloidal Silver. Providing the right concentration and particle size has been used, the Colloidal Silver is rapidly absorbed into the upper gastrointestinal tract, leaving little to interact with the beneficial \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria in our intestines.Antibiotics kill the \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria that is so vital for our gut. This, coupled with the growing resistance to modern antibiotics, encourages more people to turn to Colloidal Silver. Interestingly, Colloidal Silver actually helps to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics too.                       What can Colloidal Silver be used for?

his untimely death from cancer in 2016 at age 40, Chili lived in British Columbia\\u2019s Coast Mountains and pulled artistic inspiration from his time spent exploring the mountains, forests, and coastline of his home.\\u201cExperience is an important part of my painting,\\u201d Chili said.\\n\\u201cWhen I watch a sunset\\u2014all those super-saturated colours giving in to the dark of night\\u2014I want to condense the colours and the feeling of the whole experience and passage of time rather than just catch one specific instant.\\u201dThe linear brush strokes and deftly layered colours in Chili\\u2019s work helped him translate the motion and feeling of a landscape.\\nHe connected with the paintings of the Group of Seven\\u2014particularly Tom Thomson\\u2014 and his most recent favourite artist was Alphonse Mucha, but the primary driving force of Chili\\u2019s art was the natural world\\u2014water, wind and, notably, snow.\\u201cAs a white, snow reflects any and every color.\\nPlus, it forms more abstract shapes, or it can blow around.\\nIf you spend enough time in the backcountry you will see snow in almost every color and shape.\\nSnow gives a lot of freedom.\\u201d\\u201cNot a single colour goes onto my canvass without some tweaking,\\u201d Chili explained.\\n\\u201cAnyone can paint straight from the tube.\\u201dA trained wilderness guide, Chili originally turned to photography tried to capture the incredible landscapes and unique moments of natural beauty he would witness while exploring the mountains, forests, and coastlines of British Columbia.\\u201cBut I couldn\\u2019t get it,\\u201d he explained.\\n\\u201cA photo captures a tiny sliver of a moment, but I wanted to get that feeling of being there for the entire sunset.\\nThe way the clouds move, or the wind blowing through.\\nI found that by going back to painting I could bring a bit of the magic of spending time in nature back home with me.\\u201dAs his talent became more well known, Chili was able to retire from guiding and start adventuring solely for his own purposes (with a one-year stint as star/head guide of Wild At Heart, a television program that saw Chili take people with limited outdoor experience into some of British Columbias most heralded provincial parks).Adventures to Mexico, Nicaragua, Ireland, and Europe inspired Chili with inspiring new natural vistas (particularly ocean waves) and styles to experiment with but his heart remained bound to his homeland of beautiful British Columbia.\\u201cChili\\u2019s paintings result from experiencing the outdoors in a way that only someone who has camped on top of a mountain in the middle of winter can have experienced,\\u201d says Adrian Raeside, an author, artist and syndicated cartoonist who was also one of Chili\\u2019s early collectors.\\n\\u201cHe uses colour to create a mood in ways that no other artist can pull off.\\nAfter seeing a Chili landscape, you'll never look at nature the same again.\\u201dBut, Chili hoped, you will want to look at more of it.High In The Mountainswith Chili ThomChili offset his time at the easel or out venturing in the wilds with a social enthusiasm that touched thousands.\\nHe was an accomplished DJ (check this mix of funky breaks), a renegade DIY filmmaker (and co-founder of Whistler\\u2019s infamous Heavy Hitting HorrorFest) , an event creator (he took on the role of Artistic Director of the Athlete\\u2019s Parade for the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Paralympic Games in Whistler, BC).After he passed over to the other side, the community of Whistler honoured Chili\\u2019s legacy with The Chili Thom Experience, a 30-day, seven-venue celebration of his life and work highlighted by a Masterpieces exhibition at the prestigious Audain Art Museum.\\nThe event established  memorial scholarship fund to annually support young artists in all four communities of Chili\\u2019s Sea to Sky home turf (Squamish, Whistler, Pemberton, Mount Currie).Chili\\u2019s family and friends continue to run his art business, ensuring fans around the globe can bring some of Chili\\u2019s unique perspective on the outdoor world into their homes and

                 Colloidal Silver is a liquid made of nano sized silver particles, suspended in ultra-pure water.\\nThis natural product can help with a huge variety of health conditions in adults, children and animals.\\nIt\\u2019s known to be effective against 650 strains of bacteria, viruses and fungi, and is well-known for its skin healing properties if made correctly.\\nColloidal Silver is also the key ingredient in our topical products which means we don\\u2019t have to use any nasty artificial preservatives or parabens, so you can rest assured our products are as natural and safe as they can be.\\nAn ancient remedy                     Silver as a natural treatment is nothing new.\\nAs far back as Ancient Greece, they used a silver coin in a barrel of water to stop bacteria growing.\\nSince then, it has been used throughout the ages to fight infection, in everything from hospitals to water systems.In the early 20th Century, colloidal silver was used by doctors as it proved enormously effective against bacteria.\\nIts use declined after 1938 when antibiotics were introduced.\\nHowever, not even 100 years on and we are seeing resistance to antibiotics, and since the 70s there has been a renewed interest in Colloidal Silver.Nowadays, NASA uses a silver water system in its space shuttles, and many airlines use silver water filters.\\nSilver is also used by hospitals in burns units and to dress wounds, as well as being used in public buildings in the UK to prevent Legionnaires disease and bacteria.Curious to know more?Delve into the history of silver here\\u201cSilver has been used for centuries.\\nHippocrates wrote about the use of silver in wound care\\u2026 WW1 soldiers used silver leaf to treat infected wounds.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0                       Using it today                     Use it daily to enhance your body\\u2019s immune system, or as a first aid remedy to naturally fight infection, ailments and skin concerns.\\nIt\\u2019s also used by those with illnesses or skin conditions that cannot be treated conventionally, or who want an alternative to modern drugs.\\u201cOnce people discover our products, they find they can use them to help with so many things, and the products become a staple part of the family first aid kit.\\u201d\\u00a0 Lucy Roberts, Managing Director, Active Silver                       How does it work?\\nLike with anything in life, nature seeks to be balanced, or neutral.\\nOur bodies contain both good and bad bacteria.\\n\\u2018Good\\u2019 bacteria helps our bodies to function and provides a balance, having equal amounts of positive and negative electrical charges (ions).\\u2018Bad\\u2019 bacteria is unbalanced because it has more negative than positive ions.\\nEach of the silver particles in our Colloidal Silver is positively charged using our advanced electrolysis technique.\\nOnce ingested or in contact with skin, these particles are attracted to the spare negative ions in \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria.\\nThe Colloidal Silver rips these negative ions away, causing the \\u2018bad\\u2019 bacteria to die.\\nThe silver is then cleared out of the body by the immune, lymphatic and elimination systems.It's impossible for bacteria to build up a resistance to Colloidal Silver.\\nProviding the right concentration and particle size has been used, the Colloidal Silver is rapidly absorbed into the upper gastrointestinal tract, leaving little to interact with the beneficial \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria in our intestines.Antibiotics kill the \\u2018good\\u2019 bacteria that is so vital for our gut.\\nThis, coupled with the growing resistance to modern antibiotics, encourages more people to turn to Colloidal Silver.\\nInterestingly, Colloidal Silver actually helps to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics too.\\nWhat can Colloidal Silver be used for?\\nAbscess, Acne, Allergies, Asthma, Athletes Foot, Bites, Bladder infections, Boils, Bronchitis, Burns, Candida albicans (thrush), Catarrh, Chicken Pox, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Colds, Congestion, Conjunctivitis, Coughs, Cuts, Cysts, Cystitis, Dandruff, Dermatitis, Ear
